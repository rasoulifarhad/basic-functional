/**
 *  We have our DataFileMetadata class that represents a Data File stored in some location for a customer.
 * 
 *  Not just local files
 * 
 * A new requirement. Customers can manage their own files on their own public facing Webservers. We need to 
 * support loading data from a supplied URL.
 * 
 * If we add just this one additional field to our DataFileMetadata class, it will result in significantly more 
 * complexity making the code for that class harder to reason about.
 * 
 *    - only file or url should have a value at any given time
 *    - The other one should be null
 *    - but both should not be null.
 * 
 * Can other Functional Data types help?
 * 
 * There is a functional data type that will allow us to represent this relationship accurately : Either. 
 * 
 * Either represents a value that can be of one two defined types.
 * 
 *    Either<URL,File>
 * 
 * If this is the extent of the changes or differences between our data model for local files and remote 
 * URLs this may be an acceptable solution.
 * 
 * Inheritance too the rescue!
 * 
 * A more common solution in traditional Java is to leverage â€” inheritance! We can make DataFileMetadata an abstract 
 * base class with two different implementations, one for local files and one for remote URLs.
